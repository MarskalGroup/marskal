##Todo list: Last updated `2016-12-07`  

#### Left Off 12/7/2016
* Writing Tests for Array
* Still have a few methods to go, then clean up docs as we experiment and build our standards
* Switch to minitest:spec possibly because class names dont work as I like for tetsing


####Priorities
* Build a marskal_suite to combine all the marskal- gems into a consolidated source
* Document code and add to suite in an iterative process
* Build a command line interface
* This should be a sample of coding standards and documentation for all other marskal gems
* Decide on Which code documention format to use. RDoc or RDoc + yard or RDoc w hanna or other styling mechanism

------

####Future Features
* Add generators and templates for:
    * Documentation
    * New Gems
    * New Rails Apps
    * New Api Apps
    * New Bootstrap Apps
